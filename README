tedstreamer: Stream TED talks from the command line, with subtitles!

The program should be rather easy to use for anyone with basic
Linux CLI skills. No installation needed, the script is self-contained
and runs as-is, just change to the directory where the script is
downloaded, give the file execution permissions and run it, e.g.

git clone https://apollonk@bitbucket.org/apollonk/tedstreamer.git

cd tedstreamer

./tedstreamer.py -s en brains

(or if you don't want to / can't chmod:
python tedstreamer.py -s en brains)

You will be presented with a list of talks from which you need to
choose one (type its number and press ENTER). Try ./tedstreamer -h
to see all the other options (not too many yet!).

Tested with mpv, mplayer and vlc/cvlc. If you do not have the mpv
player, you *must* supply the -p parameter, e.g.:
./tedstreamer.py -p mplayer -s es zombie
- or just get mpv, it's great!

Example language codes for subtitles:
en = English
es = Spanish
el = Greek
zh-cn = Chinese
All codes can be found here: http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm

If you specify an unknown subtitle languagecode, or the video does not
(yet) have subtitles available for the language you requested, the script
will default to English.

Now go get inspired or something.
