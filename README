tedstreamer: Stream TED talks from the command line, with subtitles!

The program should be rather easy to use for anyone with basic
Linux CLI skills. No installation needed, the script is self-contained
and runs as-is, just change to the directory where the script is
downloaded, give the file execution permissions and run it, e.g.

./tedstreamer.py -s en brains

(or if you don't want to / can't chmod:
python tedstreamer.py -s en brains)

You will be presented with a list of talks from which you need to
choose one (type its number and press ENTER). Try ./tedstreamer -h
to see all the other options (not too many yet!).

Tested with mpv, mplayer and vlc/cvlc. Subtitles won't work for the
latter.

Now go get inspired or something!
